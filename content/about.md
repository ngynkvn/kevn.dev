Hi! My name is Kevin Nguyen and I’m studying computer science at
the *University of Florida*


Current interests include learning functional programming
(mainly Haskell), backend development, and learning category
theory and it’s applications to software engineering.


Currently looking for Summer 2020 opportunities / side projects
to work on with others :)


I manage and lead development on <a href="https://ufacm.xyz">ufacm.xyz</a>, a React single page
application for my University’s ACM chapter.


I like to play electric guitar, skateboard, and play video
games.


I’m using hugo to create
content for this website.
