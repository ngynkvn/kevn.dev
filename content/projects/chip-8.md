This is an emulator I developed over the summer to learn more
about how emulation of hardware is achieved. I used a Java
graphics library coupled with OpenGL to create it.



This project was interesting, I learned a bit more about
computer graphics and how they get rendered onto the screen. I
was exposed to opcodes and debugging them. Part of this involved
me opening the game binaries and reading the opcodes manually to
figure out why my emulator was not processing them correctly.
